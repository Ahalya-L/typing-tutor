The "Typing Tutor" program is a C-based application designed to assist users in honing their typing skills. 
The program generates random words of varying lengths for users to type, measuring their typing speed and accuracy. 
After each word input, users receive feedback on correctness, accuracy percentage, and the time taken to type. 
The program provides an interactive experience, allowing users to decide whether to continue practicing or exit. 
The overall performance summary includes statistics on correct words, total words typed, and accuracy percentage. 
The program utilizes the current time for random number seeding and typing speed measurement, ensuring variability with each run.
